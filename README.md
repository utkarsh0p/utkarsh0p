## Hi there 👋
### Hi there 👋 I'm Utkarsh!

🔭 I’m currently working on:  
A full-stack web project using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and smooth **GSAP animations**.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
Open-source web apps, DSA coding groups, or anything creative and code-driven!

🤝 I’m looking for help with:  
Mastering **data structures and algorithms** and building high-performance web applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- Nextjs ☕  
- React ⚛️  
- C++ for DSA 💻  
- Animation libraries for sleek UI 🎨

💬 Ask me about:  
Front-end development, setting up **Vim for web dev**, or tips for beginner-friendly DSA!

⚡ Fun fact:  
I once spent hours fixing a bug — turned out to be a missing semicolon 😅  
Also, I enjoy turning **coffee + code** into cool projects 🚀
